# Trivia!
I made this for Tandem's engineering apprentice application. You enter a username, and begin answering 10 trivia questions. \n
Your username and high score are stored in local storage. \n
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses React version 17.0.1

## To run the app
get into the appropriate directory: cd trivia

install local dependencies: yarn install
  -you can also use: npm install
  -Dependencies can be found in the package.json

run the app in development mode: yarn start
  -you can also use: npm start
  -Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\n
It will use the App.test.js file and rerun the tests each time you edit files.

### `yarn build`

If you want to deploy this, you can run: yarn build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
